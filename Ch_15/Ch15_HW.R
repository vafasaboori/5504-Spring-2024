# for a 1-unit increase in Wet rating, odds of purchasing are multiplied by  29.2. 
# For a 1-unit increase in Noise rating, odds of purchasing are multiplied by 6.15.
# In general odds ratio >1 indicates a positive association between IV and DV

# (e) Interpretation
# Wet and Noise ratings of 7 are both considered excellent performance ratings
# Nonetheless, the probability of repurchasing such tire is extremely low (0.0406)
# But a one-point increase in both ratings increases the probability to 0.8837
# So achieving the highest possible levels of performance is essential for manufacturer
